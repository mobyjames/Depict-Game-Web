  We've set the mold for the how characters will work. Here's a look at the first batch of concepts

A player in the game needs some kind of representation as well as creative ways to express emotion. We decided to emphasize creativity and express over structure and visual appeal. See [ep.2](#) where we discuss this dillema at length.

So, here's the plan:

* Everyone will select a character, which is used as the default representation
* Characters are not customizable, but therefore can include visual features like blinking, talking, etc
* During the game players can emote using pre-defined or custom emjoi
* Emjoi temporarily replace the character when used

In this way, we get the visual consistency, approachability and people can still go nuts with custom emjoi, animations, sign-boards... whatever.

Overall, the characters are slightly larger than the avatars from the original to allow for more detail.
