Players need some kind of representation in the game. We're trying to balance visual appeal and consistency while still giving players plenty of options for creativity. See [ep.2](#) where we discuss this dillema at length.

Here's one idea...

* Everyone will select a character, which is used as the default representation
* Characters are not customizable, but therefore can include visual features like blinking, talking, etc
* During the game players can emote using pre-defined or custom emjoi
* Emjoi temporarily replace the character when used

In this way, we get the visual consistency, approachability and people can still go nuts with custom emjoi, animations, sign-boards... whatever.

Overall, the characters are slightly larger than the avatars from the original to allow for more detail.
